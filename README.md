<h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>As a data analyst at the fictional Mint Classics Company, am helping to analyze data in a relational database with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.</p>

<h1><a name="problemstatement">Project Scenerio</a></h1>
<p></p>Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities. 

To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.</p>
