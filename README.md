<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>As a data analyst at the fictional Mint Classics Company, am helping to analyze data in a relational database with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.</p>

<h2><a name="problemstatement">Project Scenerio</a></h1>
<p> Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities. 
To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.</p>

<h2><a name="objective">Project Objective</a></h1>
<p>
1. Explore products currently in inventory.
2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.</p>

<h2><a name="database">Database Information</a></h1>
<p>The Database for this project was initially configured to MySQL pattern, I had to convert it to MSSQL pattern. Rewrote the table creations, and the data insertions with the order datails containing more that 1000 rows. I used partly AI prompting as additional assistance for ideas. It was QED.</p>

  <li><h5>Where are the top five customers aggregations located</h5></li>
	
```sql
-- Top 5 Countries of Mint Classic customers
select top 5
country, 
count(customerNumber) as [Number of Customers],
round(avg(creditLimit),0) as [Average Credit Limit]
from [mintclassics].[dbo].[customers]
group by country 
order by count(customerNumber) desc

<ul>
  <li>The SQL query retrieves the <code>customerNumber</code> shows their <code>country</code> of residents and calculates the average (<code>creditLimit</code>) in each country group they belong to.</li>
  <li>It presents data from the <code>customers</code> table.
  <li>The results are grouped by top 5 <code>country</code>.</li>
  <li>The query then calculates the average <code>creditlimit</code> for each group of customers with the same <code>country</code>.</li>
  <li>Finally, the results are sorted in descending order based on the <code>customerNumber</code> aggregation.</li>
	<li>The findings here shows that there are more customers in the USA</li>
</ul>

<li><h5>Explain MintClassic Employees hierarchy, and their aggregation per location </h5></li>
	
```sql
SELECT 
    e1.jobTitle,
    COUNT(e1.employeeNumber) AS EmployeeCount,
    COALESCE(
        CONCAT(e2.firstName, ' ', e2.lastName),
        'No one' -- This will show 'No one' for the President
    ) AS [Report to Person],

	COALESCE(
        e2.jobTitle,
        'No one' -- This will show 'No one' for the President
    ) AS [Report To Person Job Title],
	COALESCE(
        o.[country],
        'No one' -- This will show 'No one' for the President
    ) AS [Report To Person Country]
FROM 
    [mintclassics].[dbo].[employees] e1
LEFT JOIN 
    [mintclassics].[dbo].[employees] e2 ON e1.reportsTo = e2.employeeNumber
JOIN 
    [mintclassics].[dbo].[offices] o ON  e2.officeCode = o.officeCode
GROUP BY 
    e1.jobTitle,
	e2.jobTitle,
    e2.firstName, 
    e2.lastName,
	 o.[country]
ORDER BY 
    EmployeeCount DESC;
